This works for `@swc/core` version 1.3.3 or earlier:

```
npm i
npm run cli:old
npm run cli:new
npm run webpack:old
npm run webpack:new
```

Each of these steps transpiles a simple TS + React app and validates the
sourcemaps locally. The `old` approach uses `sourcemap-validator` in a CLI 
script, and the new approach uses the `source-map` to manually walk the mappings
to valiate changes.

But with `@swc/core` `1.3.4` or later there are validation issues with the
generated sourcemap using either tool which seem to be related to `swc-loader`:

```
npm install --include=dev @swc/core@1.3.4
npm run cli:old       // works
npm run cli:new       // works
npm run webpack:old   // fails ðŸ’¥ 
npm run webpack:new   // fails ðŸ’¥ 
```

The last command is recommended because it's using the `source-map` library
directly to verify the mappings and emits more details about the warnings.

This has also been seen on `sourcemaps.io` (which the `new` scripts is based
upon to enable CI verification).
